In this repository, you will find small projects carried out in Python notebooks. Below is a summary of each one and instructions on how to execute them if you wish to recreate them:

## The Majority Illusion 

**Author:** Sebastian Ahumada  
**Date:** October 2022 

**Description:**

The objective of this notebook is to perform an exercise on the majority illusion, which is a phenomenon studied in the field of network science. The notebook consists of two parts:
1) In the first part, the goal is to recreate what was done in the following paper: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0147617
2) In the second part, the goal is to provide an alternative way to study the majority illusion.

To achieve the described objectives, we will work with the networkx library.

## Auditors KPI

**Author:** Sebastian Ahumada  
**Date:** December 2021 

**Description:**

The objective of this notebook is to create KPIs to measure the performance of the Auditors based on the NC (this is a specific terminology in agriculture industry and means non-conformity) they put. The idea is to analyze the behaviours of them when they put a NC to try to identify those who may have a weird pattern.

For that I took all the population and compare them to try to identify outliers based on the rules defined in KPIs. Six KPIs were created to measure if a Auditor has or not a weird behaviour based on their NC.

For privacy reasons real data were change for data created in the same notebook.

## Pendulum Search Algorithm (PSA)

**Author:** Sebastian Ahumada  
**Date:** June 2022 

**Description:**

The objective of this notebook is to apply the PSA optimization algorithm (for more information, see the paper: https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4893/15/6/214) to the well-known SCP optimization problems, which are set covering problems. In particular, this notebook will work with SCP41, which can be downloaded from the following page: https://people.brunel.ac.uk/~mastjjb/jeb/orlib/files/scp41.txt

## Employee Retention ML

**Author:** Sebastian Ahumada  
**Date:** September 2023 

**Description:**

The objective of this notebook is to create the tables that feed the PowerBI Employee Retention Model, which can be found in the PowerBI section of this GitHub ([Link to powerBI dashboard](https://github.com/Sebastian21Ahumada/powerbi-dashboards)). The idea of the project is to segment employees from a test dataset based on certain characteristics, and then calculate for each group which variables are most important when deciding whether to leave the company.
